# Dynamic-Pricing-for-Ride-Sharing-Services

This project aims to implement a dynamic pricing strategy for ride-sharing services, taking into account demand and supply levels to adjust ride prices dynamically. The data provided includes factors such as the expected ride duration, historical ride costs, number of riders, and the number of drivers.

Key Features:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed EDA to understand the distribution of key variables and relationships between ride duration, costs, and vehicle types.
2. Correlation Analysis: Used correlation matrices to identify the relationships between numerical features.
3. Dynamic Pricing Implementation: Implemented a dynamic pricing strategy that adjusts ride prices based on high and low demand/supply periods.
4. Profitability Analysis: Evaluated the profitability of the dynamic pricing strategy compared to historical pricing, using visualization techniques.
5. Machine Learning Model: Trained a Random Forest Regressor model to predict ride prices based on various factors, including vehicle type, number of riders, and ride duration.
6. Model Evaluation: Tested the model and visualized the comparison between actual and predicted values using scatter plots.

This project provides a comprehensive approach to implementing and evaluating dynamic pricing in ride-sharing, leveraging data analytics and machine learning.
